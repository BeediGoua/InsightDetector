When LLMs Try to Reason: Experiments in Text and Vision-Based Abstraction,"Can large language models learn to reason abstractly from just a few examples? In this piece, I explore this question by testing both text-based (o3-mini) and image-capable (gpt-4.1) models on abstract grid transformation tasks. These experiments reveal the extent to which current models rely on pattern matching, procedural heuristics, and symbolic shortcuts rather than robust generalization. Even with multimodal inputs, reasoning often breaks down in the face of subtle abstraction. The results offer a window into the current capabilities and limitations of in-context meta-learning with LLMs. The post When LLMs Try to Reason: Experiments in Text and Vision-Based Abstraction appeared first on Towards Data Science .",2025-07-22T19:35:25,https://towardsdatascience.com/feed,https://towardsdatascience.com/when-llms-try-to-reason-experiments-in-text-and-vision-based-abstraction/,en,0.153,Technologie,"Technologie, International"

I'll analyze each tool to see how they differ in interfaces, keyword research resources, rank tracking, and competitor analysis. User Interface Ahrefs and SEMrush both offer comprehensive information and quick metrics regarding your website's SEO performance. However, Ahrefs takes a bit more of a hands-on approach to getting your account fully set up, whereas SEMrush's simpler dashboard can give you access to the data you need quickly. In this section, we provide a brief overview of the elements found on each dashboard and highlight the ease with which you can complete tasks. AHREFS The Ahrefs dashboard is less cluttered than that of SEMrush, and its primary menu is at the very top of the page, with a search bar designed only for entering URLs. Additional features of the Ahrefs platform include: You can see analytics from the dashboard, including search engine rankings to domain ratings, referring domains, and backlink Jumping from one tool to another is easy.

When deciding on which dashboard to use, consider what you value in the user interface, and test out both. Rank Tracking If you're looking to track your website's search engine ranking, rank tracking features can help. You can also use them to monitor your competitors. Let's take a look at Ahrefs vs. SEMrush to see which tool does a better job. Ahrefs The Ahrefs Rank Tracker is simpler to use. Just type in the domain name and keywords you want to analyze, and it spits out a report showing you the search engine results page (SERP) ranking for each keyword you enter. Rank Tracker looks at the ranking performance of keywords and compares them with the top rankings for those keywords.

Intuitive reports allow you to track statistics for the pages on your website, as well as the keywords used in those pages.

From there, you can quickly decide whether to proceed with that keyword or figure out how to rank better for other keywords. SEMrush allows you to check your mobile rankings and ranking updates daily, which is something Ahrefs does not offer. SEMrush also offers social media rankings, a tool you won't find within the Ahrefs platform. Both are good which one do you like let me know in the comment. Keyword Research Keyword research is closely related to rank tracking, but it's used for deciding which keywords you plan on using for future content rather than those you use now. When it comes to SEO, keyword research is the most important thing to consider when comparing the two platforms. AHREFS The Ahrefs Keyword Explorer provides you with thousands of keyword ideas and filters search results based on the chosen search engine. Ahrefs supports several features, including: It can search multiple keywords in a single search and analyze them together. At SEMrush, you also have this feature in Keyword Overview.

Competitor Analysis Both platforms offer competitor analysis tools, eliminating the need to come up with keywords off the top of your head. Each tool is useful for finding keywords that will be useful for your competition so you know they will be valuable to you. AHREFS Ahrefs' domain comparison tool lets you compare up to five websites (your website and four competitors) side-by-side.it also shows you how your site is ranked against others with metrics such as backlinks, domain ratings, and more. Use the Competing Domains section to see a list of your most direct competitors, and explore how many keywords matches your competitors have.

Grammarly has a more friendly UI/UX whereas; ProWritingAid offers complete feedback on big picture writing. Both ProWritingAid and Grammarly are awesome writing tools, without a doubt. but as per my experience, Grammarly is a winner here because Grammarly helps you to review and edit your content. Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarly’s editor or using the software’s native feature in other text editors. Not only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed.

Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.",2022-03-13T15:04:00,https://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/,https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/03/prowritingaid-vs-grammarly-which.html,en,0.174,Technologie,"Technologie, Économie/Business, Culture, International"
What is Blockchain: Everything You Need to Know (2022),"If you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old. Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don’t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That’s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do. It’s like your computer’s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain. Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with. A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called “Bit Gold.” However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin. So, What is Blockchain? A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin. Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions. Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy. To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps: Blockchain collects information in “blocks”. A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block. Blocks form chains, which are called “Blockchains.” More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself. Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed. Let’s get to know more about the blockchain. How does blockchain work? Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called ""Distributed Ledger Technology"" or DLT. Here’s how it works: Someone or a computer will transacts The transaction is transmitted throughout the network. A network of computers can confirm the transaction. When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block The blocks are linked together to create a history. And that’s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it’s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever. A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction. Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction. How are Blockchains used? Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum. Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination. Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products. Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been—so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks. Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world. What is Blockchain Decentralization? Blockchain technology is safe, even if it’s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection. Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised? Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes. Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called “Decentralization,” meaning all the information is stored in multiple places. Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity—not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory. Pros and Cons of Blockchain Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages. Pros Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process. One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with. Safe, private, and easy transactions Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information Cons Data storage has limits. The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place. It has a risk of being used for illicit activities Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain I’ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section. Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency? Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly. Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked? Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult. What is the most prominent blockchain company? Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy. Who owns Blockchain? Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It’s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain. What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database? Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties. Final Saying Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

Most Frequently Asked Questions About Affiliate Marketing,"There are lots of questions floating around about how affiliate marketing works, what to do and what not to do when it comes to setting up a business. With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing 1. What is affiliate marketing? Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all! 2. What is an affiliate program? An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly. 3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money? Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers. Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network. 4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping? Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands. 5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing? Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action. 6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices? Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity. 7. Where do I find qualified publishers? The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy. 8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement? An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases. 9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing? Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic. 10. What is a super affiliate? A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program. Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing. 11. How do we track publisher sales activity? Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard. 12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries? Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country. 13. How can affiliate marketing help my business? Affiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways: It allows you to save time and money on marketing, which frees you up to focus on other aspects of your business. You get access to friendly marketers who are eager to help you succeed. It also helps you to promote your products by sharing links and banners with a new audience. It offers high ROI(Return on investment) and is cost-effective. 14. How do I find quality publishers? One of the best ways to work with qualified affiliates is to hire an affiliate marketing agency that works with all the networks. Affiliates are carefully selected and go through a rigorous application process to be included in the network. 15. How Can we Promote Affiliate Links? Affiliate marketing is generally associated with websites, but there are other ways to promote your affiliate links, including: A website or blog Through email marketing and newsletter Social media, like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Leave a comment on blogs or forums. Write an e-book or other digital product. Youtube 16. Do you have to pay to sign up for an affiliate program? To build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away. 17. What is a commission rate? Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant. Who manages your affiliate program? Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency. 18. What is a cookie? Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration 19. How long do cookies last? The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its “cookie life.” The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you’ll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click. Final Saying Most new affiliates are eager to begin their affiliate marketing business. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad information out there that can lead inexperienced affiliates astray. Hopefully, the answer to your question will provide clarity on how affiliate marketing works and the pitfalls you can avoid. Most importantly, keep in mind that success in affiliate marketing takes some time. Don't be discouraged if you're not immediately making sales or earning money. It takes most new affiliates months to make a full-time income.",2022-06-01T13:03:00,https://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/,https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/06/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html,en,0.179,Technologie,"Technologie, Économie/Business, Culture, International"

Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens),"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the most popular digital assets today, capturing the attention of cryptocurrency investors, whales and people from around the world. People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs. 1) What is an NFT? NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc. 2) What is Blockchain? A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware. 3) What makes an NFT valuable? The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place. 4) How do NFTs work? One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain. As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network. NFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token. 5) What’s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency? Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT? Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creations 6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT? When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership. 7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs? The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics. In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million. 8) Can NFTs be used as an investment? Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create. 9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles? Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art. 10) How do we buy an NFTs? There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it. 11) Can i mint NFT for free? To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees. 12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it? The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet. 12) Why are people investing so much in NFT? Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don’t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet. You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections. Final Saying That’s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening.

Most Frequently Asked Questions About  Email Marketing,"1. Why is email marketing important? Email is the marketing tool that helps you create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels. 2. What is benefits of email marketing? Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company. Benefits of email marketing for bussiness: Better brand recognition Statistics of what works best More sales Targeted audience More traffic to your products/services/newsletter Build credibility Most bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing. 3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails? Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your data to decide. 4. Which metrics should I be looking at? The two most important metrics for email marketing are open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert. 5. How do I write a decent subject line? The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email, then repeated at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example ""Click here to download the premium theme for free. 6. Is email marketing still effective? Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience. 7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself? Buying an email list is waste of time & money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list. Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them. 8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing? If the subject line of the email is irrelevant to customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus on sales, offers and discounts. Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to connect with customers, get the most out of this tool. 9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email? Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM. Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are your emails will soon be diverted to spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations. 10. Where can I find email template? Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use. However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design. 11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022? Is it a trend to listen to and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win. Final Saying You can approach email marketing in different ways.
